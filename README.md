[Chinese Version](docs/README_zh.md)

## 1. Introduction

**Chat With NPC** allows players to freely chat with NPCs, who will answer questions based on his setting (Basic Prompt)
and the setting of their Groups (Nation, City, Town ,etc.). Suitable for RPG maps or puzzle maps. The NPCs would not
change the game rule (if you don't use the advanced features). NPC can also perform some actions based on the chat
content if you define it.

In the future version, we will add innovative features such as NPCs chatting with each other, NPCs' viewpoints on
events, etc., so that NPCs in the same Group can interact with each other.

## 2. How to use

Any player can **talk to NPCs by shift+clicking** on them, if the NPC has been registered by OPs. Then the NPC will
greet with players.

The NPC's speech can be seen by everyone (in the **chat bubble** above their head), or by players within a certain range
around NPC (in the **Chat bar**).

Any nearby players can **reply to the NPC in the chat bar directly** (or the nearest NPC if there are multiple NPCs near
the player).

   group.
5. Each `NPC`'s conversation will combine his own `Instructions`, the context of this
   conversation (or all the conversation if needMemory is true), the `Intructions` of his `Group` and all
